We want user1 to have access to our \u0027get_plan\u0027 endpoint but user2 can access the \u0027release\u0027 endpoint.\n\nLooks like its expected that \u0027get_plan\u0027 endpoint will be entered as a \u0027permission\u0027 under one his/her roles in AAF? Similary, user2 will be checked against a permission that contains \u0027release\u0027?",
