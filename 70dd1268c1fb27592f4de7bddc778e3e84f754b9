      "message": "If I understood this right, this assumes that the aggregation will act on ALL demands, which may not be true in all cases. For instance, if the policy is to only threshold the sum of the latency for transport and RAN, and ignore the core, this would include the core in the aggregation if the core demand is solved first right ?\n\nI\u0027m guessing the policy should specify explicitly which demands the aggregation should apply to, and only the decided candidates for those demands should be included in the aggregation.",
